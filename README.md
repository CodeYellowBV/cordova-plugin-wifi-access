Cordova Android WiFi access plugin
==================================

This is a trivial plugin to enable WIFI access on Android in a clean
way.  This permission is required when you want to use [Crosswalk](https://crosswalk-project.org) in
your Cordova project.  See the [migration page on the Crosswalk website](https://crosswalk-project.org/#documentation/cordova/migrate_an_application/migrate)
for more information on how to convert your project.

Usage
-----

Nothing is really needed.  Just add the plugin and you're set :)
